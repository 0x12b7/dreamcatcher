Performance Optimization through Object Pooling
In many JavaScript runtimes, a non-negligible portion of time is spent on garbage collection. While garbage collection is essential for automatic memory management, it can introduce overhead that impacts performance, particularly when dealing with frequently allocated and deallocated objects.

To optimize performance, it's beneficial to minimize the need for object recreation and reduce garbage collection frequency by employing object pooling. By creating long-lived objects and storing them in a pool, we can safely reuse resources without the need for repeated allocation and deallocation. This strategy, combined with the use of the Option pattern, enables efficient handling of object lifetimes, ensuring that only valid and useful objects are managed at any given time.

However, it's crucial to note that memory leaks can still occur if objects are not correctly deallocated or handled. Therefore, careful management of the object's lifetime is paramount. Pooling must be coupled with clear strategies for allocation, deallocation, and lifecycle management to avoid unintended resource retention.
